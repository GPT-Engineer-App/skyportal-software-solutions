Failed
design me a website for a software startup called Cloudscape. Cloudscape specializes in developing software solutions like building websites for clients, etc. I need you to also build multiple sections within the website that redirect to a about us section (write whatever you believe is good for that section), a mission section, and whatever other sections you think are necessary.
